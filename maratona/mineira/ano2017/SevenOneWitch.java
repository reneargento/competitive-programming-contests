/**
 * Dona Clotilde is a very nice lady who lives in a village, in house which number is 71.
 * It's not known why, but she had a reputation for being a witch.
 * Clotilde was eager to watch a football game.
 * Clotilde was eager to watch a football game.
 * One day, she bought a liquid to clean silver.
 * With this, she won a coupon that gave her a number to compete for a ticket to the 2014 World Cup semifinal at Mineir√£o,
 * the game between Germany and Brazil. The raffle happened and she won the ticket.
 * Clotilde went to the game, Brazil lost 7 x 1, and everyone in the village thought that Brazil had lost that way because of her, poor thing!
 * Her hacking nephew, San Tanaz, taking her aunt's pains, decided to create a computer virus that interfered with mathematical calculations, so that anything involving number 7 in the accounts would become 0.

 For example:
 3 + 4 = 0
 33 + 44 = 0
 17 + 11 = 21
 8 x 9 = 2
 12 x 7 = 0
 8 + 9 = 10

 Input
 Composed of a single line with two integers a and b (0 < a, b < 10000), separated by a sum or multiplication operator.

 Output
 An integer corresponding to the result of the account, after the virus.
